    <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
    <P>Furthermore, to design a management system requires someone who has studied programing specially in system administration and that person must have a lot of knowledge which will help him or her to design the system but the greats obstacle is that when you are designing a system you must have tools to use such as computers, network, servers and other tools.
        Lastly, I assume that the ICT has been a tool to use in education system rather than other technologies which can be used in term of managing and building a powerful education.
